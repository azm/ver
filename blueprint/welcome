Welcome to VER, the Vim & Emacs in Ruby editor.

This project can be found at: http://github.com/manveru/ver

Note that M usually stands for the alt key on your keyboard

Various help commands:
  [M-h h] : Open help browser
  [M-h k] : Query help for key
  [M-h g] : Grep help
  [M-h t] : Open tutorial

Quick intro:

VER is a modal editor, drawing from both Emacs and Vim for inspiration, as they are both excellent projects but have very different downsides.
I tried to address these downsides:

  * Use of a real programming language (Ruby) for implementation, configuration and scripting (no ancient elisp or crazy vimscript)
  * Easy to use keymappings to emulate other editors while maintaining the strength of a live environment.
  * I don't intend this editor to be everything for everybody, it's just useful for myself for now.
  * Make editing powerful without years of learning and remembering arcane shortcuts, and don't require users of the editor to sacrifice their wrists.
  * Allow project-based browsing and grepping right from the start.

Current notable features:

  * Fuzzy, project based file browser using M-o
  * Normal, system-wide file browser using C-o
  * Quick switching buffers using M-1 to M-9
  - Switching buffers by partial name using M-b
  * Save file using C-s
  - Save file under different name using M-s
  - Quick executing of methods in the current mode via C-x
  - Live ruby console using M-x
  * Copy and paste selections, start selection with v or V, copy with y, paste with p
